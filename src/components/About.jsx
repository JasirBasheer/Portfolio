         <h2>Short bio</h2>
         <p>I'm a product maker (... and full stack developer) currently based in Kerala, INDIA. I'm passionate about building products that help people and make a difference in the world. I'm also a big fan of open source software  I also love educating others about technology and programming, which is why I'm a content creator and write blogs in my free time.</p>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>I sold my first venture, at an age of 16. And then went on to build and fail a lot of times. I also worked as a freelancer, creating and selling discord bots and landing pages. 
<br />
I've won several hackathons as well, like Hakero, by Fetlla, which was the biggest hackathon of the time.</p>
  
  <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
  <p>I'm excited to connect with others via email (jasirbinbasheer@gmail.com) and Twitter to chat about projects and ideas. Currently, I'm not taking on freelance projects, but I am open to hearing about potential opportunities, discussing them with you and then potentially collaborating if it's a good fit.</p>
